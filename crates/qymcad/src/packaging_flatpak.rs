//! THE FLATPAK MANIFEST IS BUILT TO FLATHUB'S CONDITIONS, AND THE ID IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE.
//!
//! Two of Flathub's conditions shape the whole manifest: the application must be built ENTIRELY FROM
//! SOURCE, and THERE IS NO NETWORK DURING THE BUILD. So the kernel is a module of its own with a checksum,
//! and every crate arrives as a declared source - a build that tries to fetch anything simply stops.
//!
//! THE APPLICATION ID IS PERMANENT. It names the manifest, the desktop entry, the metainfo, the icon, the
//! directory of a person's settings and the page in the store. The project lives at github.com/grengojbo, so
//! the id is `io.github.grengojbo.qymcad`, the form Flathub gives a project hosted there. Written in six places,
//! and this is what keeps them one.
