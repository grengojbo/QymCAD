//! A CRASH FILE NOBODY IS TOLD ABOUT IS THE SAME AS NO CRASH FILE.
//!
//! The reports are written into the data directory of the program — a place no person has heard of and
//! none will look in. So the next start says the last run ended in an error and hands the path over.
//!
//! Shown ONCE: after it is closed the file is renamed rather than deleted, because the person may still
//! want to attach it, and a window that returns every start is a window people learn to dismiss without
//! reading.
//!
//! ONCE MEANS FOR ALL OF THEM. The start used to pick up a single report - the newest unseen one - so
//! two crashes meant two starts and two windows, and closing the first only brought the second. Measured
//! on the reporter's own directory: two files, two launches, and both renamed to `.seen.txt` one launch
//! apart, which is exactly what "it comes up every time" looks like from the outside.
