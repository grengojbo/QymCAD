# Updates

**Help -> Check for updates**.

The program asks its release page on GitHub whether a version newer than yours has come out, and says so in the status line
at the bottom of the window. When there is something to update to, a bright line appears there with the
new version number — press it and a window opens with the details.

## What happens when you press it

A window opens: your version, the available version with its date, and what changed in it. At the bottom
there is one button — **Open the release page**. It opens a browser on the page holding the files for
every system and the full list of changes.

**The program downloads nothing and does not replace itself.** You fetch the file with the browser and
install it the same way you did the first time.

## If you installed through a package manager

Update the same way you installed:

| installed from | update with |
|---|---|
| AUR (`qymcad-bin`) | your AUR helper |
| winget | `winget upgrade` |
| Flatpak | the software centre, or `flatpak update` |

There is no need to download the file from the release page in these cases: it will not replace the
package but sit beside it, and you end up with two programs instead of one.

**Inside Flatpak this is absent altogether** — no menu item, no line in the settings. The store updates the
package and tells you about new versions itself.

## How often to ask

**Settings -> General -> Check for updates**: at every start, once a day (the default), once a week, once
a month, or never. The menu item works whichever is chosen, including "never".

## What goes over the network

One request to `https://github.com/grengojbo/QymCAD/releases/latest/download/latest.json` — a small file
attached to the newest release of the program. The request says nothing about your copy: not the version,
not the system, not how the program was installed, no name of yours or of your machine. Documents, models
and file paths go nowhere, ever.

To switch it off, choose "never" in the same setting. There are then no requests at all.

## If it does not work

* **"Could not reach the site"** — there is no network, or the site is not answering. This does not mean
  "no updates": the answer is unknown. Try again later.
* **"No updates found"** in the window — yours is the newest version. An automatic check that finds
  nothing says nothing: the status line stays empty.
* **"This version has been declared unfit. Please update."** — the release you have has a known fault; update
  from the release page.
* **There is no menu item** — you are either inside Flatpak or running a build you compiled yourself. A
  hand-built copy has nothing to compare against: its version number is the same between releases.
