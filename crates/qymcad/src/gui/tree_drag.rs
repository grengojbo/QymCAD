//! DRAGGING IN THE TREE: ORDER AND GROUPING.
//!
//! Two requests:
//!
//! * dragging parts and subassemblies within an assembly in the list, so that the order in the tree of
//!   the right-hand panel can simply be changed for convenience (pure cosmetics);
//! * if selected parts or subassemblies are dropped onto another part or assembly, a new subassembly is
//!   created and everything selected goes into it along with the one that was dropped on.
//!
//! Both gestures are one movement of the mouse, so they are told apart by THE PLACE of the drop: at the
//! edges of a row it reorders, in the middle it gathers things inside. The middle band is wider than the
//! edges: it is easier to hit, and grouping makes more sense than an exact reordering.
