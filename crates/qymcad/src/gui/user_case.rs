//! A SCENARIO OF REAL USE: what a person does in the first fifteen minutes.
//!
//! Reported: five minutes of working by hand turn up enough faults that a simple project cannot be
//! assembled, while every check here stays green - and that is strange. It is strange, and the report was
//! right: the checks ran one action at a time on a cube, while what breaks is A CHAIN - a sketch on a face
//! of another part, holes, a shell, a second part, an assembly, a dimension edited in the middle of it.
//!
//! Here there is one scenario and one check after EVERY step: the geometry, the tree on the left, the panel
//! on the right, the lists of bodies, the absence of keys where words belong. That is how a person works,
//! and that is how it must be checked.
