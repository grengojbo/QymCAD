//! OPEN A PROJECT AND IT IS SIMPLY OPEN. Written from a report: on opening a project the bodies are
//! sometimes not visible until you rebuild.
//!
//! "Sometimes" means a PARAMETRIC project. The snapshot of the parameter values (`params_seen`) was
//! moved only by a SYNCHRONOUS rebuild, while in a live window the rebuild is asynchronous — so the
//! snapshot was NEVER updated. Every parameter counted as changed for ever: the scheduler marked all
//! the parametrics dirty, the frame asked for a rebuild, the rebuild did not move the snapshot — and
//! the circle repeated. An opened project rebuilt WITHOUT END, and for nothing: it has no live B-rep
//! yet (the geometry comes from the bundle), so every such rebuild failed with "the source body is not
//! built".
//!
//! The tests hold BOTH boundaries. "The bodies are on screen" is weak on its own: the circle did not
//! erase them, it kept the window in a rebuild with an error in the status line. "Exactly one rebuild"
//! is weak on its own too: zero rebuilds would pass it, and "nothing was built" would pass along with
//! it.
