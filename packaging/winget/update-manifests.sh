# WHY TEMPLATES RATHER THAN FILES KEPT UP TO DATE BY HAND. Three of the values - the version, the checksum
# and the product code - are known only once a release exists, and a manifest carrying invented ones is
# worse than none: it is a file that looks finished and installs the wrong thing. So the repository keeps
# the shape, and this writes the copy that gets submitted.
#
# The result lands in dist/winget/manifests/g/grengojbo/QymCAD/<version>/ - the exact path microsoft's
# repository uses, so submitting is a copy of one directory.
