//! THE PROGRAM ANSWERS TO ONE NAME, IN EVERY PLACE THAT ASKS.
//!
//! The same reverse-DNS name identifies the program to the desktop, to macOS, to Flathub, and it decides
//! the directory a person's settings, colour schemes, templates and library of parts live in. It is said in
//! four places that cannot share a constant - Rust, a shell script, a YAML manifest, an XML description -
//! so it is compared instead.
//!
//! MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS MADE ONE. Three different names were in the tree at once - one in the code, another
//! in the macOS bundle, a third in the Flatpak manifest. Nothing was broken by it - each half worked alone -
//! which is exactly why it had gone unnoticed through two releases.
//!
//! WHAT IS NOT COMPARED HERE, and deliberately: `grengojbo.QymCAD` in the winget manifest and `qymcad-bin`
//! in the AUR package. Those catalogues have naming rules of their own, `Publisher.Package` and the Arch
//! convention, and forcing a reverse-DNS name on them would be wrong rather than consistent.
