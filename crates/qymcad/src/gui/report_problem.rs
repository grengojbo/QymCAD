//! "REPORT A PROBLEM": what the person writes, what goes with it, and where it is sent.
//!
//! There is no network here and there will not be. Sending straight to a tracker means a token, and a
//! token in the binary of an open program is extracted in a minute and used to post in the owner's
//! name. So the program does the half a person cannot: it gathers the files and fills the form in
//! ADVANCE, through the address bar - GitHub reads its issue forms' fields out of the query string.
//! What it cannot do through a link is attach files, so those are gathered into one folder and the
//! folder is opened, ready to drag from.
//!
//! THE DOCUMENT IS NEVER ATTACHED BY DEFAULT. An issue is public for ever and a model is the person's
//! own work; the tick is theirs to make, with the consequence written beside it. Everything else -
//! the environment, the crash file, a picture of the window - carries nothing of theirs.
