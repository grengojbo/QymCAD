//! THE VIEW CUBE — a navigation cube, as in grown-up CAD.
//!
//! What there was: 36 pixels, six flat faces, snapping ONLY to six normals and no highlight under the
//! cursor. That is, the commonest action — "set the isometric view" — could not be done with the cube at
//! all, and hitting a face had to be guessed blind.
//!
//! What there is now: **26 zones** — 6 faces, 12 edges, 8 corners. A click on a corner gives the
//! isometric view, on an edge a view at 45 degrees. It is for the sake of those zones that the cube is
//! drawn TRUNCATED (with chamfers along the edges and corners): a chamfer is not decoration but the very
//! zone that has to be hit. A flat cube could not show where to aim.
//!
//! The geometry is a truncated cube on 48 vertices: every sign and permutation of `(H, T, S)` with
//! `H > T > S`. The zones are derived from that rather than enumerated by hand:
//!
//! - a **face** is an octagon of the vertices whose chosen coordinate equals `H`;
//! - an **edge** is a quadrilateral of the vertices whose two coordinates equal `H` and `T`;
//! - a **corner** is a polygon of the vertices around a corner.
//!
//! That way the set of zones cannot diverge from the picture: THE SAME THING is drawn and picked.
