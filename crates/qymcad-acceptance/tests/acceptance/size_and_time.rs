//! SIZE AND TIME: projects of real size opened and rebuilt, and meshes of real size brought in, within the time a
//! person waits for in a professional system - a project open in seconds, rebuilt in under half a minute, a mesh of
//! two hundred thousand triangles in under half a minute, and no frame of the window stalled past the budget of every
//! step. The set is a debug build, several times slower than what people run: the budgets are set for it.
//!
//! The private samples (`samples/`, not published) close the letter as a cross-check: what they show must already be
//! caught by the checks built on files anyone has.
