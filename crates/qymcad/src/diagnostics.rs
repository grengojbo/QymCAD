//! WHAT THE MACHINE WAS, when the trouble happened.
//!
//! Half of the complaints about a viewport - black, torn, upside down - are answered by the graphics
//! adapter and the drawing path and by nothing else, and neither can be guessed from a screenshot. The
//! rest of it is cheap to collect and expensive to ask for afterwards: asking costs a round trip to a
//! person who has already moved on.
//!
//! Everything here is gathered once and kept in globals rather than read from `App`, because the other
//! reader is the panic hook: it runs while the frame still holds the application and may not reach it.
//!
//! THE BLOCK IS IN ENGLISH whatever language the window speaks. It is read by whoever picks the report
//! up, not by whoever sends it.
