//! SAVING DOES NOT STAY SILENT.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: opening another project, closing the current one or closing the application
//! brings up a "Save / Save as" window, and there should be a popup with a spinner so that a person
//! does not think the program went quiet — it is saving the current project in order to open another.
//!
//! It really did stay silent, and worse than reported: on answering "Save" the interface went into a
//! BLOCKING wait for the write (`wait_bg`) and no frame was painted at all. To a person that is
//! indistinguishable from a frozen program.
