//! THE START SCREEN.
//!
//! The program used to open straight into an empty document: the first thing a person saw told them
//! nothing — not what to open, not where to begin, not where the help is. Now it is a screen with the
//! recent files, two kinds of new document, opening, and the parts library.
//!
//! IT IS SHOWN ONLY ON A BLANK SLATE. A screen over somebody's work is a modal that gets closed
//! without being read; so it goes out as soon as anything appears in the document, and does not come
//! back by itself. It can be brought back from a menu item — but it will never stand between a person
//! and their geometry.
//!
//! THERE IS NO "EXAMPLES" SECTION HERE, AND THAT IS HONEST. An examples section was asked for, but
//! there is not one example project in the distribution: drawing an empty section would mean lying on
//! the very first screen. In its place is the parts library, which the distribution DOES have.
