//! HOTKEYS CAN BE REBOUND.
//!
//! The reference sheet was for viewing only, and it could not have been otherwise: the handlers
//! matched on THE KEY (`match key { Key::E => extrude }`), that is, the letter and the meaning were
//! one and the same. Moving the letter would have meant rewriting the `match` — rebinding was
//! inexpressible by construction.
//!
//! Now THE ACTION comes first: a key leads to an action (`hotkey_action`), and the action to a branch
//! of the handler. The first link is what moves; the second is not touched at all.
