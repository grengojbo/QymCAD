//! AN EDGE ANCHOR STAYS ALIVE AFTER THE FILE IS OPENED.
//!
//! A carriage is put on a rail with an EDGE anchor: then the travel runs ALONG the rail rather than
//! along the normal of a face. On the reported machine that ended like this: the hand takes the tool,
//! switches the anchor to "edge", clicks the edge of the rail and the edge of the carriage — the joint
//! is created and IMMEDIATELY declared faulty ("the anchor is lost"), its travel 0.000 mm, no axis of
//! travel at all.
//!
//! The cause is TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES OF EDGES. The click lands on an edge because the picking takes
//! them from the LIVE B-rep (`body_edges_cached` -> `shape.edges_with_ids()`). But `connector_frame`
//! resolves the anchor through the `regen_edges` OF THE MODEL, and that is filled only by the post
//! pass of a rebuild. Opening a file does not rebuild: a bundle stores meshes and faces, not edges.
//! Measured on the reported machine: 138 bodies, faces on all 138, EDGES ON TWO, a live B-rep on all
//! 138.
//!
//! Checked here is the whole path as a person walks it: build, save, open again, place a joint on an
//! edge — and the joint must be sound.
