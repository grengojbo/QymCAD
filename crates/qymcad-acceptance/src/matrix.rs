//! THE TOOLS OF THE PART ACROSS BODIES, PICKS AND VALUES. A tool tried on one edge of one block says nothing about

//! a body built through the window, the edges a person clicks on it, a value typed, and what must come of it: the
//! body cut or grown by what the geometry says, a face of the right kind for every edge picked, one correct solid no
