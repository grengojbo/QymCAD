//! Drivers of a project: what may be substituted into any dimension field.
//!
//! A global parameter such as `w = 50` and a named driving dimension of a sketch are the same thing from the
//! outside: a name that can be written into a formula. The difference is that a parameter lives in the project
//! while a driver lives in a particular sketch of a particular part.
//!
//! **And here is the trouble, found by measurement.** `param_map` stores drivers under a bare name: two
//! dimensions called `len` in different parts are both accepted, but only the last one remains in scope.
//!
//! ```text
//! named: A=true, B=true; drivers in the project: 2
//! in scope, 'len' = 70.0
//!    driver 'len' in sketch A, value 20.0   <- unreachable
//!    driver 'len' in sketch B, value 70.0
//! ```
//!
//! This looks like a convenience problem — names in different assemblies, parts and sketches may coincide, so
//! a search is needed along with an indication of which part a driver belongs to — but it is a correctness
//! problem too: without a path a name is not unambiguous, and there is no way to tell which of two dimensions
//! is being moved.
//!
//! What is assembled here is a list of drivers carrying breadcrumbs (`Assembly.Part.Sketch`), a value and an
//! honest ambiguity flag, so that the completion list shows what exactly is being substituted and identically
//! named drivers do not look alike.
