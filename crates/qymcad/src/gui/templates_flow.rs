//! DOCUMENT TEMPLATES.
//!
//! Templates are what make DOCUMENT settings useful: without them the geometry tolerance, the author
//! and the other properties would have to be set again in every new file.
//!
//! A template is an ordinary document, not a separate entity: introducing a "template format"
//! alongside the document format would mean maintaining two formats obliged to do the same thing.
//!
//! THERE IS ONE MAIN DANGER HERE, and it is about losing work: a document created FROM a template
//! must not remember the path of the template. Otherwise the very first Save writes the work over the
//! template itself — and a person loses both the template and their confidence that their files are
//! where they left them.
