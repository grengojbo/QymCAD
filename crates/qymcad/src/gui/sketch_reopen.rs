//! ENTER A LATE SKETCH, LEAVE IT, AND THE FEATURE TURNS RED. Written from a report.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: start the program with a project, open sketch 15, close it — and the cut at
//! the very end of the timeline turns red with "the source body is not built, fix the feature earlier
//! in the timeline first". Meanwhile the 3D view has not rebuilt and the cut is there on the part.
//! "Rebuild everything" makes the error go away and it never comes back. So it only happens on the
//! first run.
//!
//! THE CAUSE IS IN THE WORD "LATE". A project from a bundle shows the geometry FROM THE FILE and has
//! no live `Shape`s (lazy B-rep): those are built on demand. Leaving a sketch marks ONLY its own node
//! dirty and rebuilds — while the feature standing on it asks for a source body that is not in the
//! live cache yet. "Rebuild everything" builds the chain from the start, which is why it does not
//! happen again afterwards.
//!
//! The first version of this test did not catch it, because it went through the sketches IN A ROW: by
//! the fifteenth one the live bodies had already been built by the previous steps. It is caught only
//! on a sketch that has an unbuilt source earlier in the timeline — and on a FRESH opening.
