//! "SAVE?" IS ASKED ONLY WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING TO SAVE. Written from reports.
//!
//! 1. Open a project, do nothing in it, close it — and the save-or-not message pops up at once. The
//!    question was asked honestly by the edit key, but that key includes `geom_rev`, the revision of
//!    the DRAWING cache, which any rebuild moves. And opening a project is what causes a rebuild.
//!
//!    The rule "a rebuild is not a person's edit" had already been derived in the code, but applied
//!    only to the guard of operation boundaries (`committed_key`). For "is it saved?" it was
//!    forgotten — and it stayed quiet exactly as long as the rebuild after opening ran
//!    synchronously.
//!
//! 2. Press save — and that is it, the window for opening a new project never appears. The write goes
//!    in the BACKGROUND, and the dirtiness was checked straight after the request to save: by that
//!    moment the file had not yet landed on the disk, the project counted as dirty, and the
//!    navigation was thrown away. A person has already said "save it and move on" — their command
//!    must not be lost.
