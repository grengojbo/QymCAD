//! Running `packaging/macos/bundle.sh` here, with the two mac-only tools replaced by stubs.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. That script runs on one runner, the most expensive of the three, at the very END of a
//! build - so a mistake in it costs a whole build to find, and is found one line at a time. The first run
//! died before it, on the link. The second died INSIDE it after six minutes and printed nothing at all:
//! `grep` matched no library naming the build machine, `grep` returns 1 when it matches nothing, and
//! `set -o pipefail` turned that into the end of the script.
//!
//! `install_name_tool` and `otool` exist only on macOS. They are replaced by two stubs on PATH - one
//! records what it was asked to do and remembers which files it rewrote, the other prints a dependency
//! list in the real format and answers according to those marks. Everything the mistakes were actually in
//! - the copying, the loops, the sentinel, the archive - is ordinary shell and runs anywhere.
