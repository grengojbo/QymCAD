//! Reported behaviour: on Windows 11 with an old card and no graphics driver the program starts, blinks
//! and closes. Nothing in the crash folder, nothing on screen, nothing to send.
//!
//! Two reasons for that silence, and both are answered here. A start-up failure comes back as an ordinary
//! error rather than a panic, so the crash hook never saw it (`crash::note_failed_start` now does). And the
//! message went to standard error - which a windowed build on Windows has nowhere to print to, so it went
//! nowhere at all. The system's own message box is the one thing certain to be seen when ours never opened.
