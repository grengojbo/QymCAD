//! THE COMMAND SEARCH WORKS.
//!
//! Forty icons in two scrolling columns amount to "I know it exists but I do not remember where".
//! Grown-up CAD is saved by exactly this: press, type three letters, apply. Checked here is that the
//! search really searches, really launches, and does not introduce a launch path of its own that goes
//! round the button.
//!
//! The Russian queries below stay in Cyrillic: they are SEARCH KEYS into the Russian catalogue, and the
//! whole point of those checks is that a Russian substring finds the command.
