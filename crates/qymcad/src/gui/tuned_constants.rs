//! HARD-CODED NUMBERS BECAME SETTINGS — AND ARE APPLIED.
//!
//! Four constants answered questions whose answer differs for everybody: how often to write an
//! autosave, how many undo steps to keep, how transparent the ghosts are, and how wide the perspective
//! looks. The price of "one value for all" differs too — from an extra pause on a heavy assembly to an
//! invisible preview — and it is not ours to charge on somebody's behalf.
//!
//! The tests here check not "the field was stored" but WHETHER IT IS APPLIED. A setting that was
//! recorded and never applied is the worst kind of working code: it looks like it works and does
//! nothing.
