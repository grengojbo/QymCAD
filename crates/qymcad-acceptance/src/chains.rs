//! GENERATED SESSIONS: chains of a person's steps, grown from a seed out of the descriptions of the tools.
//!
//! A chain is what a person does in a sitting, in the order they do it and with the slips they make: a tool taken
//! by one of its ways in, its clicks, a value typed into its field - one it takes or one it must refuse - Enter and
//! Esc in between, a click on nothing, a step taken back and put again, the document saved and opened in the middle.
//! The descriptions say what each tool is taken by, clicked at and typed into; the seed says which of them, in what
//! order. The same seed grows the same chain, so a chain that finds something can be played again.
//!
//! Playing a chain is done through the session alone, and every step is looked at by the oracles of the process. A
//! step the session cannot aim - the place of a click is covered, the field it types into is not open - is skipped,
//! as a person would not make it; a step after which the oracles find the program not right ends the chain with
//! the step, its number and their words.
