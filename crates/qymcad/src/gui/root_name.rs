//! THE ROOT ASSEMBLY HAS NO NAME OF ITS OWN.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: in an English build the top crumb read the root assembly in Russian — and the
//! root assembly cannot be renamed by a person at all, so why is it in one language rather than the
//! interface language?
//!
//! Right on both counts. The root always exists and there is exactly one: it is not a component
//! somebody created, it is the document itself. While its name was an ordinary string, it froze in
//! the language of the build the document was created in. A name is translated only if it is a
//! CATALOGUE KEY; the key now sits there, and is put there on every load — otherwise a document
//! whose string has already frozen would have nothing to fix it with.
