# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A PAIR OF EDITS BY HAND. Three things have to agree - the version pacman sees, the
# name the file really has on the release page, and the checksum of that file - and they are edited in
# three different lines. Done by hand, the checksum is the one that gets forgotten, and a stale checksum
# does not fail quietly: it fails on somebody else's machine, at install time, with a message about
# corruption.
#
# THE CHECKSUM COMES FROM THE RELEASE ITSELF, not from a downloaded copy: GitHub publishes the digest of
# every asset, so nothing has to be fetched to learn it.
