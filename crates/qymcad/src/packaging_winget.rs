//! THE WINGET MANIFEST SAYS ONE THING IN THREE FILES, AND THE PRODUCT CODE IS THE ONE THE MSI CARRIES.
//!
//! A winget manifest is three YAML files - a version, a locale and an installer - and every one of them
//! repeats the package identifier and the version. They are submitted together and rejected together, and
//! the rejection is a bot comment three days later.
//!
//! THE PRODUCT CODE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. Windows tells one installed version from another by it, and
//! `winget upgrade` uses it to recognise what it put there. It must differ between versions - otherwise an
//! upgrade turns into "the same thing is already installed" - so it cannot be a constant; and it must be
//! knowable without opening the MSI, so it cannot be random either. It is computed from the version, by
//! the same rule in two places: `build-msi.ps1` (PowerShell, on a Windows runner) writes it into the
//! installer, `update-manifests.sh` (shell, on Linux, hours later) writes it into the manifest. Two
//! languages, two machines, one number - which is exactly the shape of thing that drifts.
