# THE LIBRARIES THAT ARE OPENED BY NAME AT RUN TIME, and are therefore invisible to `ldd`.
#
# Reported behaviour: the AppImage check of appimage.github.io ran the package under firejail and it
# panicked with "Library libxkbcommon-x11.so could not be loaded."
#
# linuxdeploy gathers what the ELF header asks for. The window stack does not ask: `xkbcommon-dl`,
# `x11-dl` and `wayland-sys` open their libraries with `dlopen` by plain name, so none of them appears in
# `ldd` and none of them was packed. Measured on the built binary: `ldd` names libX11, libxcb, libXau and
# libXdmcp - and not one of libxkbcommon, libxkbcommon-x11, libXcursor, libXrandr, libXi or libwayland-*.
# On a machine that happens to have them installed the package starts; on a bare one it dies on the first.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: libGL, libEGL, libvulkan and libwayland-client. Those are the system's
# side of the graphics stack and must come from the system - a copy carried inside the package talks to a
# compositor or a driver it was not built against.
#
# Reported behaviour: the package built with libwayland-client inside died on a Wayland desktop with
# "WGPU error: Failed to create surface for any enabled backend: {}". Measured on that very package: with
# all three wayland libraries inside it fails; with libwayland-client.so.0 alone deleted the window opens.
# Its two neighbours, libwayland-cursor and libwayland-egl, turned out to be dead weight in both
# directions - a machine running a compositor already has them, and a machine without one never reaches
# the Wayland path at all - so they are gone too.

# past that list, which is how libwayland-client got inside: linuxdeploy would have refused it on its own.
# So the request is checked against this before it is made.
#
# The whole wayland group is here, not only the one that broke: without libwayland-client there is no
# conversation with a compositor for the other two to take part in, and a machine that has a compositor
# has all three already.
