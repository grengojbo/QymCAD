//! EVERY CHECK IN A PROCESS OF ITS OWN, and within its time and its memory.
//!
//! Checks run side by side, and a session is a whole program: its frames and its rebuild call the geometry kernel.
//! OCCT keeps shared state without protection, and the program takes its kernel lock only around a rebuild - one
//! program has one rebuild at a time, and its frames rarely touch the kernel while one runs. Two programs in one
//! process break that: the frame of one check meets the rebuild of another inside OCCT, and a check fails, or
//! passes, for a reason that is not in the program. So each check runs in a child process of the same test binary,
//! with the kernel all to itself, while the checks still run side by side.
//!
//! The child is the same binary asked for that one check. It is told apart by `QYMCAD_ACCEPTANCE_CHILD`;
//! `QYMCAD_ACCEPTANCE_IN_PROCESS` runs a check in place, for a debugger.
