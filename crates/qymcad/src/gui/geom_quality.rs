//! THE GEOMETRY TOLERANCE TRAVELS WITH THE DOCUMENT.
//!
//! The tessellation deflection used to be a constant in `qymcad-kernel`. Both the picture on screen and
//! what goes into an STL depend on it — so make it a setting of THE PROGRAM and one and the same file
//! would give two people a DIFFERENT export. Each of them would be certain the program was lying, and
//! there would be nothing to find it with: both files are identical, it is the machines that differ.
//!
//! So the tolerance is a property of THE DOCUMENT. Jewellery needs one, a machine frame another, and
//! it is decided by whoever drew it, not by whoever opened it.
