//! F1 ANSWERS ABOUT THE TOOL IN HAND.
//!
//! Context help rested on a hand-written enumeration and knew ONE Assembly tool out of nine: the mate
//! pick. Holding an anchor, a group, a width, a tangency, a relation, ground, an axis pick or a
//! re-pick, a person pressing F1 got the table of contents — an answer of "go find it yourself",
//! exactly at the minute they were stuck.
//!
//! This is the same disease that already produced blind highlighting and stuck tools: a list living
//! apart from the single source. So the check walks `AssemblyTool::ALL` rather than a list of its own,
//! and a new tool lands here by itself.
