//! A KERNEL ERROR TURNED INTO WORDS.
//!
//! It sat in the dictionary crate and dragged the whole document crate in with it. The rule is the other
//! way round: the kernel gives a CODE, and whoever has a window picks the words. So the mapping lives
//! here, and the dictionary knows nothing of features, errors or bodies.
/// A KERNEL ERROR -> TEXT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PERSON.
///
/// The kernel names A FACT (`SplitPieceCount { got, want }`), and the words are chosen here. The numbers
/// are passed AS ARGUMENTS rather than glued into the string in advance: in different languages they land
/// in different places in the phrase.
