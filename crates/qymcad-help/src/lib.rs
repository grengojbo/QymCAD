//! THE HELP: `.md` articles baked into the binary, and their rendering.

//! ONE SOURCE, TWO SHOP WINDOWS. The same files `docs/help/{ru,en}/**.md` go both into this window and
//! onto the site. Two sets of texts about one thing would diverge at the very first edit, and would
//! diverge silently.
//!
//! THE RENDERING IS OURS, NOT A CRATE'S. `egui_commonmark` drags in pulldown-cmark and a way of its own
//! with images, while what is needed is a predictable look: headings, paragraphs, lists, code, emphasis,
//! links, a quote, a rule. Our own parser is a hundred and fifty lines, and in exchange the colours come
//! from THE SCHEME and the fonts are ours; somebody else's renderer would bring its own and drift apart
//! from the light theme exactly as the canvas once did.
