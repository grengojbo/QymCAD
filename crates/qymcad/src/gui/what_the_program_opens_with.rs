//! WHAT THE PROGRAM OPENS WITH, and why it is decided in one named place.
//!
//! Two reports, and they turned out to be one question:
//!
//! * "in an empty project remove the empty part - a person opens the CAD and sees an empty part; the first
//!   time round that spoils everything";
//! * "add a setting to reopen the last project ... and a tick for always showing the start screen".
//!
//! Both are answers to "which document does the program start with", and that decision used to live inside
//! the launch closure - a place no check can run. So it was "always reopen the last project", written once
//! and measured never.
//!
//! It is `qymcad_ui_state::opening` now: two flags in, three outcomes out, every one of them somebody's
//! first minute.
//!
//! WHY THE EMPTY DOCUMENT IS NOT `App::default()`. That one hands out a document WITH a part, and about
//! five hundred checks build their scene on it - measured: taking the part out of it fails 75 of them. A
//! part is right for a check that needs somewhere to draw, and right for "New part", which is what the
//! person asked for. It is wrong only for the first minute, and that is what changed.
