//! THE HELP IS WRITTEN FOR WHOEVER WORKS IN THE PROGRAM, not for whoever makes it.
//!
//! Reported after reading the article about the keys: why should people using the CAD need to know
//! what is assembled from where, or that something is not laziness? Help texts must be written for
//! people who use the CAD, not as work reports.
//!
//! That is right, and the miss is systemic: the articles were written in the same voice a work report
//! is written in — defending decisions ("that is not laziness", "more honest than"), exposing innards
//! ("stored by a persistent kernel name") and telling the history of the development ("that was
//! exactly the stumble").
//!
//! A person at their part needs something else: what to press, what will happen, and what to do if it
//! did not work.
//!
//! WHAT THIS GUARD CANNOT DO. It will not check the tone as a whole — that is work for eyes. It
//! catches TWO things a machine tells apart reliably: the developer's vocabulary (the list below is
//! collected from real findings) and the structural damage that comes of appending — a repeated
//! section, languages that have drifted apart. Both times the article was already bad, and both times
//! nobody saw it for years.

/// Every help article: the path and the text.
