//! THE VIEW CUBE — the whole path a person walks.
//!
//! The main thing the cube lacked: a click on a CORNER (the isometric view) and on an EDGE (a view at 45
//! degrees). It is for their sake that the cube is truncated — a chamfer is a zone, not decoration. What
//! is checked here is that the zones exist, that they are hit where they should be and that they give a
