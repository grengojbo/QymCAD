//! A MODAL WINDOW MUST BE MODAL. Written from a report.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: the dimming behind the rebuild window works, but it does not block mouse clicks
//! on the CAD's own interface — buttons and menus can still be pressed at that moment, which is
//! wrong.
//!
//! The dimming really was only DRAWN. The input was muted by a line of
//! `ctx.input_mut(|i| i.events.clear())` in the handler of the background task — and that line was
//! late by construction: `egui` gathers the input state at the start of a pass, while the events were
//! being cleared inside it. By that moment the presses have been parsed.
//!
//! The cost of the mistake is not cosmetic: while a rebuild runs, the document lives in the WORKING
//! COPY of the thread, and an edit that slipped through the dimming would land on a stale model.
