//! THE LOCALISATION RATCHET: a counter of Russian strings in the code that can only GO DOWN.
//!
//! IT COUNTS THE WHOLE WORKSPACE, not the application alone. The first version looked at the
//! interface crate — and showed zero while Russian captions were still visible in an English build:
//! the words sat in the KERNEL (kinds of joint, thread standards, materials) and in the bridge to OCCT
//! (error texts). The kernel is a library and has no language: it must give out CODES, and the
//! application picks the words. While the counter did not see the kernel, that rule was held by
//! nothing.
//!
//! The language framework stands, and the interface hardly goes through it: there are more than two
//! thousand strings typed straight into the code. They cannot be translated in one sitting — that is
//! weeks, and every edit would have to be checked for somebody falling back into the old habit. That
//! was already caught once: a colour-scheme screen was written in Russian text with the catalogue
//! alive.
//!
//! So what is here is not "we will finish it some day" but a MECHANISM. The test counts the Russian
//! literals in the working code and compares them against a ceiling. There is one rule:
//!
//! - **more than before means a red test.** A new screen must go through the catalogue from the start,
//!   like everything already translated;
//! - **fewer than before means a red test too**, and asks for the ceiling to be lowered. Otherwise
//!   slack piles up silently, and one day a whole screen hides under it again.
//!
//! The ceiling in [`CEILING`] is not "this many mistakes are allowed", it is a MARK of how far the
//! work has come. It moves only downwards and only along with the translation.
/// THE WORKING PART OF A FILE — up to the test MODULE rather than up to the first `#[cfg(test)]`.
///
/// Cutting at the first occurrence was a mistake: `#[cfg(test)]` also stands on test facades in the
/// middle of the code. Because of that the counter silently did not see half of `gui.rs` and
/// `sketching.rs` — and showed zero where Russian captions were visible on screen. A test module is
/// recognised by `mod` immediately after the attribute.
///
/// A VISIBILITY BEFORE `mod` IS A TEST MODULE TOO. A fixture used by neighbouring modules has to be
/// opened up (`pub(in crate::gui) mod tests`), and the counter stumbled on that: the file stopped
/// being cut at all, its tests went into the count of Russian strings, and the build reddened where
/// not one line of working code had changed.
/// The Russian literals in a file — WITHOUT the comments and without the test part.
