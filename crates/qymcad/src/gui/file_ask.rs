//! ASKING FOR A FILE WITHOUT THE PROGRAM FALLING SILENT.
//!
//! A file chooser is the system's own window with a loop of its own, and it does not return until an answer
//! is given. Called straight out of a frame, `rfd::FileDialog::pick_file()` holds the frame thread inside
//! that loop: our window draws nothing for as long as the chooser is open, and a desktop that has had no
//! answer from a window for a few seconds paints "the application is not responding" over it.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: opening a project brings up the chooser and then a system notice that the program
//! has stopped responding.
//!
//! So the chooser is STARTED on the frame thread - macOS begins the panel inside the constructor and takes
//! the main thread for it - and AWAITED on a worker, which sends the answer down a channel. Frames keep
//! being drawn all the while; what was to be done with the file is held here as a continuation and runs on
//! whichever later frame the answer lands in.
