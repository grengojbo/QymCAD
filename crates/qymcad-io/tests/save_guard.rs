//! A save does not destroy work. This test was written after a loss.
//!
//! An empty document landed on top of a finished project of 1217 nodes, with nowhere to recover it from: an
//! atomic swap saves from a truncated write but not from writing the wrong thing. A copy of the previous version
//! and a refusal to write empty over non-empty are the two things that would have saved that day.
