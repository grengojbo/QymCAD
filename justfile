# QymCAD - development and packaging commands.
# `just` = casey/just (Arch: pacman -S just). The list of commands: `just --list`.
#
# THE DEV WORKFLOW DOES NOT CHANGE: `cargo run` / `cargo test` in the dev profile, as always.
# Packages are built SEPARATELY (release) and do not disturb the dev environment.

# run the application in dev mode (as usual)

# Locally (in a Win10/11 VM with Visual Studio Build Tools) it goes like this - the kernel is built from
# source first, see packaging/README.md:
#   $env:OCCT_INCLUDE_DIR = "C:\occt\include\opencascade"; $env:OCCT_ROOT = "C:\occt"
#   cargo build --release --bin qymcad; pwsh -File packaging/win/bundle.ps1

# clear out what packaging produced
