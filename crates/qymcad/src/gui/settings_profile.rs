//! A SETTINGS PROFILE: carry it to another machine, share it, attach it to a report.
//!
//! What matters here is not the writing to a file but that the settings come into force by ONE path.
//! The theme, the language and the interface scale live not only in the record but also in the state
//! of `egui`, which is not remembered between runs. While that was done by a list of calls at
//! startup, the second path (import) would have had to repeat the same list — and would have drifted
//! from it at the very first new setting, and silently at that: the record is right and the screen
//! shows the old thing.
