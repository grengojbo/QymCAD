//! A COMPUTER WITH NO WORKING GRAPHICS DRIVER.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: on Windows 11 with an old card and no driver installed the program starts, blinks
//! and closes. There was nothing in the crash folder, and no falling back to drawing on the processor
//! either. The same version started without trouble on a virtual machine and on a modern card.
//!
//! Three answers, and each is checked here as far as a machine WITH graphics allows. The adapter is chosen
//! by us rather than by the framework, so a processor adapter is taken instead of refused. A start that
//! never reached a window leaves a report, which it did not before - it comes back as an ordinary error
//! and the panic hook never saw it. And the block that report carries names every adapter the machine
//! offered, because "no graphics at all" and "three cards, none of which will draw here" want different
//! answers.
