//! THE COMMAND CATALOGUE AND THE PANEL DO NOT DRIFT APART.
//!
//! The catalogue is what the search needs, but a list inside the search would fall behind the panel
//! at the very first new feature. That has already happened twice and both times was fixed the same
//! way: one rule and a guard that holds the link in BOTH directions. The same here — a button in the
//! panel must have a row in the catalogue, a row in the catalogue must have a button.
//!
//! The same means that holds the help together (`help_map_flow`): the table does not draw the
//! buttons, but the build goes red the moment they diverge.
