//! THE REBUILD CARD HOLDS ITS OWN WORDS.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: the text runs out past the edges of the rebuild window. The card was a fixed 280 px
//! wide with the label painted centred inside it, which held only while the label was short - and the line
//! that names how many nodes are being rebuilt and that a thread is among them is half again as wide.
//!
//! Checked on what is actually painted rather than on the numbers that went in: the card and the words are
//! both taken out of a real frame, and every word has to lie inside the card.
