//! THE PROGRAM FROM OUTSIDE: a session is the whole program in a window with no screen, and the only door the
//! acceptance checks have.
//!
//! What a session gives is what a person has - the mouse, the keyboard, the wheel, the answer to a file chooser -
//! and what it shows is what a person sees: the words on screen, the status line, the document as the program
//! reports it. The application behind it stays private to the crate, so a check cannot set a field, call a
//! handler or start a rebuild the window would not have started: it does not compile.
