//! EVERYTHING THE PROGRAM KEEPS FOR A PERSON LIVES IN ONE FOLDER.

//! Reported behaviour: "settings and crash reports turned up in `~/.local/share/cad`". That was repaired by
//! naming the folder in `qymcad-paths` - and the repair covered only what goes through that door. THE
//! SETTINGS DO NOT: they are written by the framework, which picks a folder of its own from the application
//! id. So the program went on keeping a person's things in two places at once, measured on Windows as
//! `AppData\Roaming\<the whole id>\data\app.ron` for the settings against `AppData\Roaming\<organisation>\qymcad\`
//! for the schemes, the templates, the parts library and the crash reports.
