//! OPENING A FILE IS NOT OBLIGED TO BUILD EVERYTHING AGAIN.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: make a cut in one part and sit waiting a couple of minutes for the rebuild.
//! Measurement found the culprit: the edit itself in a built project costs a second (2 nodes out of
//! 28), whereas the FIRST operation after opening a file rebuilds the whole timeline — 13.4 s on the
//! reported file. The cause is not the scheduler: the bundle held meshes and faces, that is the
//! geometry of DISPLAY, while nobody had a live body, and `ensure_brep` honestly marked the whole
//! document dirty.
//!
//! Now the live body travels into the file next to the mesh. Checked here is that the save-and-open
//! round trip puts it back and there is nothing left to rebuild.
