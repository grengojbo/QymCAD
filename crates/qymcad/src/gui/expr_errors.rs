//! AN ERROR IN A FORMULA SAYS WHAT IS WRONG.
//!
//! The expression parser ALWAYS knew the reason: `ExprError` lists nine kinds, and all nine are
//! translated into both languages. The reason was lost at the last step — in the interface, and
//! differently in each of four places:
//!
//! * the parameters window printed `(!)` — a red bracket with no words;
//! * the sketch dimension popup showed `Display`, that is, ENGLISH text in a non-English interface;
//! * the gizmo popup and the command popup said "the expression was not evaluated" — a phrase
//!   identical for a typo, an unknown name and a division by zero, that is, saying nothing at all;
//! * the command popup on top of that did not name the FIELD, though a command can have four of them.
//!
//! Now there is one door — `i18n::expr_error_text` — and the guards hold three things: the reason
//! reaches the screen, it is in the language of the interface, and the catch-all excuse has not come
//! back.
