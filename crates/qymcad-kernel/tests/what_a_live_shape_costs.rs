//! WHAT A LIVE BODY COSTS IN MEMORY - a measurement, not a check.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: with the reference V8 engine open (a STEP of 374 MB, 1170 imported solids) the program
//! held 5.24 GB and the window went sluggish. Part of that is the scene on the card, and part is the LIVE
//! B-REP: for an imported body the kernel shape cannot be rebuilt from a recipe, only by parsing the embedded
//! STEP again, so it is kept for as long as the document is open.
//!
//! Before deciding whether to let those shapes go and restore them on demand, the price has to be known. The
//! number here is the resident memory of the process, because there is no way to ask a kernel shape how much
//! it occupies - it is a tree of C++ objects behind a handle.
//!
//! `QYM_STEP` points the measurement at any file; with none given it makes its own from a body of 6 faces
//! written `QYM_STEP_COPIES` times over (200 by default).
