//! IS THERE A NEWER VERSION, AND WHAT SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT IT.
//!
//! A program that never says a new version exists leaves people on the one they installed. Measured on
//! this project in September 2026: 470 downloads, 300 clones of the repository and 10-20 people in the
//! chat - so the overwhelming majority of those running it are reachable by nothing at all, and every
//! fix made since their download is invisible to them.
//!
//! WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It does not download, unpack or replace anything. Behind self-replacement
//! come resuming a broken transfer, checksums, write permissions, the macOS quarantine flag and an
//! argument with an antivirus on Windows; a browser does all of that better and every person already
//! has one. This asks one question, and a button opens the release page.
//!
//! WHERE THE ANSWER COMES FROM: a small record, `latest.json`, attached to every release of this program's own
//! repository by the release run on a tag. `releases/latest/download/` always names the newest release, so one
//! fixed address serves every copy ever handed out, and no site of our own is needed to answer it. A release is
//! made by a person pressing the button against a tag, so a version nobody chose to publish does not exist here.
//!
//! WHAT GOES OUT: one GET of that address and nothing about the copy that asks - no version, no system, no way it
//! was installed. Documents, models and paths go nowhere, ever.

/// WHERE THE ANSWER COMES FROM. Frozen into every binary handed out: copies installed today will knock at it for
/// years.
